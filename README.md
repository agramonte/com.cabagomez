Use: 
1. Clone this repo to the location of your plugins. On a typical mac this would be "/Users/yourname/Solar2DPlugins/". The content of this repo should be at the root of "/Users/yourname/Solar2DPlugins/com.cabagomez/". Not sure of the location on a pc.   
2. Now add the particular plugin you want to use by adding this to your build settings. For example for the base of ironsource:

        },
